# üí´ About Me:
From a very early age, I was passionate about mathematics and problem-solving. Later on, this aspect would influence my career choice and ultimately my professional vocation. I am a software developer passionate about the pursuit of knowledge, not only in new technologies but also in methods, concepts, and programming paradigms. I tend to be very self-taught and enjoy understanding how things work underneath.<br><br>Currently, I have solid experience in creating, maintaining, testing, and deploying mobile applications. However, in the long term, I aspire to become a software architect.<br><br>If I can assist you in any way, I am just a message away.
